# Enki
manage translations based on formatmessage/ICU style data with an easy to use web frontend

## Why?

Almost the full tool chain for creating and managing localized web applications is there

* ICU message format
* formatjs, format-message to add localization to your code
* babel/webpack integration to extract messages
* ...

only part missing: a great and easy to use frontend to manage the translations (and most importantly: usable for the non-developer that is making the translation)

There are some localization tools that provide the full tool chain, but they are not as flexible nor comprehensive.

In old Unix fashion, Enki only tries to do one job but one job right: keep your translatiosn up to date.

## Usage

TBD

## Internals

Enki is built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). The tool is heavily inspired by [Mady](https://github.com/guigrpa/mady) and [react-intl-translations-manager](https://github.com/GertjanReynaert/react-intl-translations-manager)

## [Changelog](https://github.com/cospired/enki/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Why *Enki*?

The tool is named after Enki, the confuser of languages. According to Sumerian myth, he is responsible for the world having many tongues:

> Changed the speech in their mouths, [brought] contention into it,
> Into the speech of man that (until then) had been one.

So without him, this tool would not be necessary.
